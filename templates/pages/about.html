      MEDICS database contains searchable data on the academic studies and medical careers of all Finnish physicians
      who graduated and were entered into the medical register between 1896 and 1929. Their total number is a little
      short of 1000. Since the primary selection criterion has been graduation and “legitimation” (laillistaminen), or
      medical registration, the cohort does not include people who studied medicine but did not graduate as licentiates
      of medicine. Licentiate of Medicine degree was (and is) the basic medical degree in Finland. Neither does MEDICS
      include foreign doctors who worked in Finland with a special permission, “venia practicandi”. Almost all doctors
      included in the database graduated from the Medical Faculty of the University of Helsinki (called the Imperial
      Alexander University until 1917), which was the only medical school in the country, after which they were licensed
      by the National Board of Health (Lääkintöhallitus).

      The data was collected from various public registers and publications (Lääkärien nimikirjat, lääkärimatrikkelit,
      Valtiokalenteri etc.) as part of the research project Exclusive Treatment: Women’s Entry into Medicine in Finland,
      1882-1917, carried out by Senior Research Fellow Heini Hakosalo (University of Oulu) and funded by the Academy of
      Finland.
